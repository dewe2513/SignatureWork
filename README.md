# SignatureWork
This is a signature work portfolio as part of my capstone course at the University of St. Thomas. It contains details regarding various projects I have worked on while at St. Thomas.

## Overview
For this portfolio I have chosen three of my most meaningful projects while at St. Thomas. These projects include a Healthcare dashboard, a dynamic website, and my personal website. While it would be impossible to gather the entirety of my St. Thomas experience into only three projects, this portfolio captures a small peek at the skills I have gained and person I have become in the last 3.5 years while attending the University of St. Thomas.

Each project section includes a link to the Github page which holds the project. There is further information on the Github page regarding the project as well as how to deploy and use the project yourself. 


## Project 1
This project is a healthcare dashboard I built using PowerBI in my Business Intelligence course last spring. The dashboard takes patient data from various sources and displays it in an interactive PowerBI dashboard. From the dashboard, a user can gain various insights into symptoms, diseases, and common treatments. Creating the dashboard involved data search using Kaggle, pre processing data, building the interactive features, and writing python scripts for data analysis.

This project is meaningful to me due to my longstanding interest in the field of healthcare. It is a representation of how the fields of computer science and healthcare can be merged to create incredibly useful tools and investigate data for the benefit of all. I have a curiosity to explore tons of different fields in my life and this project is a perfect representation of that. 

## Project 2
My second project represents the skills I developed in my Web Development course in my final semester at St. Thomas. . The project itself is a dynamic web page which populates data from water usage across the world. The website can be used to analyze data and compare and contrast the sustainability efforts of various regions. The course itself was part of a sustainability flag at the University of St. Thomas. This is part of a University wide effort to focus on and be a positive influence on the growing problems of pollution and environmental sustainability representing the overarching ideals of "The Common Good" which drives the mission of St. Thomas.

The project is meaningful to me as it represents the beginning of my exposure to real Web Development. I had limited expereience with Web Development prior to this course. The skills I gained in this class turned out to be invaluable in my job search and my Senior Capstone class. Web Development is a growing industry which contains various different sub fields and the knowledge I gained will continue to prove useful in further years. 

## Project 3
The third project on my page is a representation of myself. It is a Personal Webpage consisting of a home page, resume page, project page, and personal page. I developed this at the beginning of my Web Development course. The page shows off my creativity and front end web development skills I have gained in the course. I had meant to develop something similar for a long while but kept putting it off. When I got the assignment in class I was truly excited as I would be able to create something truly for myself.

This project is where I truly got the chance to express myself and show people who I am. The deb design itself shows my programming skills while the content of the page shows the various experiences I have had and offers a peek into my personality and personal life. This website will prove to be a lifelong asset as I wil continue to update it as I grow in my career and life.
